# Migraine
Migraine is a Brainfuck interpreter written -- in a naive way -- in Zig. 

## Why? Why not!? 
I`ve been learning Zig for about two months and I needed a fun project to materialize all the knowledge acquired plus a big dose of misunderstandings. 

All part of my learning process: sometimes I need to build and run something, revisit it after a while to refactor it or even completely rewrite it with new ideas. 

So feel free to try it, love it or hate it but definetely don`t take it too seriously. After all, its just another Brainfuck interpreter.

## Usage
### Help
```bash
./migraine --help
Migraine 0.0.2a
Usage:
    migraine --file=file_name.bf [options]

Global Options:
    --help          Print this help.
    --file          The brainfuck source-code file path
    --eval          String is interpreted as a brainfuck program
    --verbose       
    --about         

Memory Related Options:
    --size          The memory size in Bytes. The default size is the same as the original 
                    brainfuck interpreter (30KB).

    --dyna          Instantiate memory dynamically without any fixed bound. (Not Implemented)
        
Input Related Options:
    --input         Non interactive mode. Pass all the input needed 
                    to run the program. If not passed, a input prompt will
                    appear to collect one Byte at a time, when the program
                    requests a read ','.  (Not Implemented)

    --input-int     Non interactive mode. Pass inputs as comma separated  
                    integers from 0 to 255(0-255) and convert each integer as Byte. (Not Implemented)

Output Related Options:
    --alwaysFlush   Flush as output is generated by a brainfuck program  (Not Implemented)
    --buffered      Enable buffered output, flushing output only at the end of the program`s execution. (Not Implemented)
