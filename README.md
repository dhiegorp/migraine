# Migraine
Migraine is a Brainfuck interpreter written -- in a naive way -- in Zig. 

## Why? Why not!? 
I`ve been learning Zig for about two months and I needed a fun project to materialize all the knowledge acquired plus a big dose of misunderstandings. 

All part of my learning process: sometimes I need to build and run something, revisit it after a while to refactor it or even completely rewrite it with new ideas. 

So feel free to try it, love it or hate it but definetely don`t take it too seriously. After all, its just another Brainfuck interpreter.
